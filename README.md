Installation files and Guide : &lt;<https://t.me/IronAutoPlugin>&gt;    
  
Thechnical Info : &lt;<https://github.com/farhamxp/Iron-Pro-Plugins/wiki>&gt;
   
Note : This repository has two branchs. Plugins branch has the last version of each plugin and   
ArchivedPlugin branch has Archives of plugins.

If everyone wants to create new fork of this repository, it's not problem. But that's fork unusable in AutoPlugin.  
Dear plugin creators : If your output files maked with Thechnical Info structure, that,s usable with AutoPlugin.  
Please tell me to share them with other Icone iron users.
